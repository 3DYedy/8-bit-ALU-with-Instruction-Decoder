8-bit ALU with Instruction Decoder (SystemVerilog)1. OverviewThis project implements a simplified 8-bit Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) with an integrated instruction decoder, inspired by the internal structure of a basic processor datapath.The ALU performs arithmetic and logical operations on two 8-bit input operands and routes the result to one of four selectable destinations (e.g., register blocks). In addition to the main result, the design generates status flags to signal conditions such as overflow or zero results.2. ArchitectureThe system follows a modular RTL approach, separating computation from control logic:Instruction Decoder: Decodes the 16-bit instruction word to drive the control signals.Arithmetic & Logic Modules: Dedicated units for addition, subtraction, and bitwise operations.Shift & Comparator Modules: Handles logical shifts and equality comparisons.Special Logic Module: A unique pattern matcher for MSB/LSB equality.Output Routing Logic: A 4-way demultiplexer for destination selection.3. Instruction FormatThe 16-bit instruction word mimics a simplified ISA, allowing for hierarchical decoding:Bit RangeFunctionDescription[15:14]Output SelectionRoutes result to out0, out1, out2, or out3[13:12]Category SelectionSelects Arithmetic, Logic, Special, or Zero categories[11:10]Operation SelectionSelects the specific opcode within a category[9:0]ReservedAvailable for future immediate values or extensions4. Supported OperationsArithmetic UnitADD / SUB: Standard 8-bit operations.Overflow Detection: Generated when the result exceeds the unsigned 8-bit range:$$Result > (2^{8} - 1)$$$$Overflow = 1$$Logic & Shift UnitsBitwise: AND, OR, XOR operations.Shifters: Logical Shift Left and Right on in0 by the amount specified in in1.Comparator: Equality check (comp_eq) between inputs.Special ModuleOutputs 1 if the Most Significant Bit (MSB) and Least Significant Bit (LSB) of both inputs are identical:$$MSB(in_0) = LSB(in_0) = MSB(in_1) = LSB(in_1) \implies Special = 1$$5. Status FlagsOverflow Flag: Set to 1 when the sum of two numbers cannot be represented within 8 bits.Zero Flag: Set to 1 whenever the final computed result is exactly 0.6. Simulation & VerificationThe design was validated in Xilinx Vivado using a comprehensive testbench and waveform analysis.Figure 1: Behavioral simulation showing successful instruction decoding, output routing, and flag triggering.Verification Milestones:Verified Overflow logic during 200 + 150 addition (Result: 94 with Flag=1).Validated Zero Flag activation during bitwise AND nullification (AA & 55 = 0).Confirmed correct 4-way Demultiplexing across all output channels.Author: Eduard PaladeDate: February 2026Tools: SystemVerilog, Xilinx Vivado
